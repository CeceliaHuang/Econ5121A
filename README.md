### Chinese University of Hong Kong, Fall 2020
# ECON5121A: Econometric Theory and Applications

“All theory is gray, my friend. But forever green is the tree of life.”
---Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: *Faust: Part I*



### Description

This is an entry-level Ph.D. econometrics course. Under the asymptotic framework, it covers estimation and inference of the regression models and the instrumental variable models. It focuses on theory --- applying statistical theory to econometric models. It is NOT about how to apply econometric methods to empirical data.



### Textbooks

The lectures are based primarily on Bruce Hansen's textbooks:

* Hansen (2020): [Introduction to Econometrics](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/probability/)] (**IE**)

* Hansen (2020): [Econometrics](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/) (**E**) 

Both are downloadable for free.





Reading and Assignment will be updated each week as the class progresses.

### Reading

Week 0: IE Ch.1-6
Weak 1: TBD

I encourage anyone, in particular students taking my class, to contribute or improve the notes. Send me pull requests.
