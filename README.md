### Description

This is an entry-level Ph.D. econometrics course. Under the asymptotic framework, it covers estimation and inference of the regression models and the instrumental variable models. It focuses on theory --- applying statistical theory to econometric models. It is NOT about how to apply econometric methods to empirical data.



### Textbooks

The lectures are based primarily on Bruce Hansen's textbooks:

* Hansen (2020): [Introduction to Econometrics](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/probability/)] (**IE**)

* Hansen (2020): [Econometrics](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/) (**E**) 

Both are downloadable for free.




### Lecture Notes

My lecture notes and code demonstrations can be found at

* [Lecture Notes](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ5121A/tree/master/lec_notes_lyx)
* [Jupyter Notebooks (python)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zhentaoshi/Econ5121A/master)

**Caveat**: This is an ongoing writing project. The text is incomplete, and may contain errors.
*Use them at your own risk!*

I encourage anyone, in particular students taking my class, to contribute or improve the notes. Send me pull requests.



### Lecture Hours

Friday 8:30—11:15 am. [Zoom link](https://cuhk.zoom.us/j/92063037640).

The course will be taught online until further notice.

Dates: September 11, 18, 25; October 9, 16, 23, 30; November 6, 13, 20, 27; Dec 4 (12 lectures)



### Assessment

* Attendance (15%): open webcam in each class
* Assignment (35%): hand in one week after assignment
* Final (50%): open-book, but no electric devices are allowed



### Prerequisites

Undergraduate level *multivariate calculus* (two semesters), *linear algebra* (one semester), and *probability and statistics* (one semester). Undergraduate *econometrics* is a plus, though not necessary.
