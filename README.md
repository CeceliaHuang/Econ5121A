### Description

This is an entry-level Ph.D. econometrics course. Under the asymptotic framework, it covers estimation and inference of the regression models and the instrumental variable models. It focuses on theory --- applying statistical theory to econometric models. It is NOT about how to apply econometric methods to empirical data.



### Textbooks

The lectures are based primarily on Bruce Hansen's textbooks:

* Hansen (2020): [Introduction to Econometrics](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/probability/)] (**IE**)

* Hansen (2020): [Econometrics](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/) (**E**) 

Both are downloadable for free.




### Lecture Notes

My lecture notes and code demonstrations can be found at

* [Lecture Notes](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ5121A/tree/master/lec_notes_lyx)
* [Jupyter Notebooks (python)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zhentaoshi/Econ5121A/master)

**Caveat**: This is an ongoing writing project. The text is incomplete, and may contain errors.
*Use them at your own risk!*

I encourage anyone, in particular students taking my class, to contribute or improve the notes. Send me pull requests.
