# ECON5121A: Econometric Theory and Applications

“All theory is gray, my friend. But forever green is the tree of life.”
---Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: *Faust: Part I*



### Description

This is an entry-level Ph.D. econometrics course. Under the asymptotic framework, it covers estimation and inference of the regression models and the instrumental variable models. It focuses on theory --- applying statistical theory to econometric models. It is NOT about how to apply econometric methods to empirical data.



### Textbooks

The lectures are based primarily on Bruce Hansen's textbooks:

* Hansen (2020): Introduction to Econometrics [[link](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/probability/)]

* Hansen (2020): Econometrics [[link](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/)]

Both are downloadable for free.

I encourage anyone, in particular students taking my class, to contribute or improve the notes. Send me pull requests.
